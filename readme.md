## Description of this noteTaker Application
    
It is teaching me the basic of api routes to .get/.post and .delete. It also showed me how to assign ID when a user inputs a note. The application saves your note with title and body/text and displays it in a list format to the right of the input field, with a delete button giving us the ability to delete any note we no longer want saved.
